## Why it's good to follow this rule?

- **Consistency:** The rule encourages consistent ordering of `script`, `template`, and `style` tags within Vue single-file components. Consistency in code structure makes it easier for developers to navigate and understand the codebase quickly.
- **Readability:** A consistent order of elements improves readability. Developers can quickly locate specific sections of the component without having to search through the entire file.
- **Maintainability:** When all components follow the same structure, it becomes easier to maintain and update the codebase. Developers can expect to find certain elements in specific locations, reducing cognitive load.
- **Collaboration:** A standardized component structure facilitates better collaboration among team members. Everyone knows where to expect certain elements, leading to smoother code reviews and easier pair programming.
