## Global Styles

Checks if the component is using global styles instead of `scoped` styles. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

## ❓ Why it's good to follow this rule?

- **Maintainability** limiting the `css` for the actual component makes it easier to maintain and understand.
- **Isolation** the component is isolated and has no unwanted effect on the other parts of the application.
- **Reusability** the component can be reused in other parts of the application with exactly the same look and feel.
