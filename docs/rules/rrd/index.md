# ðŸ’» rrd Rules

These ruleset is the most opinionated with rules that are not part of the *offical* Vue style guide. They are based on the experience of this repo owner and are meant to help you write better Vue code.

## Why it's good to follow this ruleset?

Opinionated means that there is a clear path to follow. This is good for teams because it helps to have a consistent codebase. It also helps to avoid common pitfalls and bugs.
