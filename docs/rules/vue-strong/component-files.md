## üò± Examples of code for which this rule will throw a warning

::: warning
The following code defines multiple components within a single file. This is against the rule that states each component should be in its own file to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.

```vue
<script setup>
app.component('TodoList', {
  // ...
})

app.component('TodoItem', {
  // ...
})
</script>
```

## ü§© How to fix it?

::: tip
Refactor the code by creating separate files for each component to adhere to best practices. Here‚Äôs how to organize them:
:::

```vue
<!-- components/TodoList.vue -->
<script setup>
// TodoList component logic
</script>
```
```vue
<!-- components/TodoItem.vue -->
<script setup>
// TodoItem component logic
</script>
```
