::: warning
This rule enforces using directive shorthands for better readability. While the official style guide allows using shorthands "**always** or **never**", this rule will flag non-shorthands as code smell.
:::

## ‚ùì Why it's good to follow this rule?

- **Readability:** Directive shorthands are easier to read and understand and result in a shorter block of code.
- **Consistency:** Using shorthands makes the code more consistent and easier to maintain.
