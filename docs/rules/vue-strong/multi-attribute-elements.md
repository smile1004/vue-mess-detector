## ❓ Why it's good to follow this rule?

- **Readability**: Spreading attributes across multiple lines makes it easier to read and understand the code.
- **Maintainability**: When attributes are on separate lines, it's simpler to add, remove, or modify them without affecting other attributes.
- **Consistency**: Following this convention helps maintain a consistent style across components, making it easier for teams to collaborate.
- **Debugging**: Having one attribute per line makes it easier to identify issues related to specific attributes, especially when debugging.
