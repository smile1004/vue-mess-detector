# eslint-plugin-vue vs Vue Mess Detector

Eslint and [eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue) are the de facto standard for linting Vue.js code. We highly encourage you to use them. Vue Mess Detector is not ment to replace them, but to complement them.

## Comparison table

| Aspect | eslint-plugin-vue | Vue Mess Detector |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Primary Focus | Linting Vue.js code | Comprehensive code analysis and quality assessment |
| Type of Tool | ESLint plugin | Standalone analysis tool |
| Installation | Via `npm`/`yarn` as an ESLint plugin | Via `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, or `JSR` registry |
| Configuration | Uses `.eslintrc` or `eslint.config.js` | Uses command-line options or `.config/vue-mess-detector.json` |
| Integration | Integrated with ESLint ecosystem | Standalone with various integrations (VSCode, Nuxt devtools, etc.) |
| Rules/Checks | Primarily syntax and style checks | Broader analysis including code health metrics |
| Customization | Highly customizable through ESLint | Less customizable through command-line options, and configuration file |
| Output Formats | Depends on ESLint output formatting | `text`, `table`, or `JSON` output |
| Grouping Results | N/A | Can group results by file or rule |
| Code Health Score | Not provided | Calculates an overall code health score |
| Continuous Integration | Through ESLint CI setups | GitHub Action |
| Browser Integration | Through ESLint editor integrations | Nuxt Devtools, Vue devtools |
| Target Audience | Developers familiar with ESLint | Potentially broader, including those new to linting |
| Learning Curve | Steeper (requires ESLint knowledge) | Potentially easier for newcomers |
| Scope | Vue.js specific | Vue.js and Nuxt.js projects |
| Parsing | Uses vue-eslint-parser | Mainly regular expressions |
| Rule Configurations | Multiple predefined configs (e.g., essential, recommended) | Rulesets can be applied or ignored |
| Community | Large, established ESLint community | Newer, growing community |

## Vue Mess Detector Extra Rules

Almost all of the [rrd](./rules/rrd/index.md) and [security](./rules/security/index.md) rules are not present in `eslint-plugin-vue`. Many of them are opinionated and based on the experiences of the several vue developers.

## Target audience

Both tools are designed to improve the quality and maintainability of Vue.js projects. `eslint-plugin-vue` is an ESLint plugin focused on linting Vue.js code, ensuring it adheres to syntax and style guidelines. `Vue Mess Detector`, on the other hand, is a standalone tool that conducts a comprehensive analysis of code quality, including metrics for code health.

## Installation and configuration

In terms of installation and configuration, `eslint-plugin-vue` is installed as an ESLint plugin and configured through ESLint's configuration files. `Vue Mess Detector` offers more flexibility in installation, supporting various package managers, and can be configured using command-line options or a dedicated configuration file.

## Integration capabilities

The tools differ significantly in their integration capabilities. `eslint-plugin-vue` is tightly integrated with the ESLint ecosystem, while `Vue Mess Detector` offers standalone functionality with integrations into various development environments, such as VSCode and Nuxt devtools.

## Customization

The types of checks and customization options also vary between the tools. `eslint-plugin-vue` primarily focuses on syntax and style checks, offering high customizability through ESLint. `Vue Mess Detector`, with its broader analysis capabilities, and more opiniated rules and approach.

## Output formats and grouping

The output formats and grouping capabilities of the tools differ as well. `eslint-plugin-vue`'s output formatting depends on ESLint's configuration, while `Vue Mess Detector` offers text, table, or JSON output formats and can group results by file or rule. 

## Code health score

`Vue Mess Detector` calculates an overall code health score, which is not provided by `eslint-plugin-vue`.

## Learning curve and community

Both tools have different target audiences and learning curves. `eslint-plugin-vue` is geared towards developers already familiar with ESLint, requiring a steeper learning curve. `Vue Mess Detector`, with its more comprehensive analysis capabilities, may be more accessible to developers new to linting and code analysis.

The scope of the tools also differs, with `eslint-plugin-vue` focusing specifically on Vue.js projects and `Vue Mess Detector` supporting both Vue.js and Nuxt.js projects. The parsing mechanisms used by the tools are distinct, with `eslint-plugin-vue` utilizing vue-eslint-parser and `Vue Mess Detector` relying mainly on regular expressions.

Finally, the community support for the tools varies, with `eslint-plugin-vue` benefiting from the large, established ESLint community and `Vue Mess Detector` having a newer, growing community.
